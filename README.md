# Barber-Customer


Now, let's talk about how the corrected code works like this game:

1. *Setting Up the Shop*:
   - We decide how many barbers (3) and chairs (5) we have.
   - We also decide how long the shop is open (10 seconds for this game).

2. *Opening the Shop*:
   - We tell each barber (using a goroutine, which is like a little worker) to start their day.
   - We check the time to make sure the shop only lets customers in for 10 seconds.

3. *Customers Come In*:
   - Every so often, a new customer (another little worker) comes to the shop.
   - If they find a chair, they sit. If not, they leave.
   - If a barber is available, the customer wakes them up.

4. *Barbers Do Haircuts*:
   - When a barber gets a customer, they cut hair for a little bit (we pretend it takes time by waiting for a few moments).
   - After the haircut, the customer is happy and leaves.

5. *Shop Closing Time*:
   - When 10 seconds pass, the shop stops letting new customers in.
   - But if there are still customers inside, the barbers keep working until everyone is done.

6. *Barbers Go Home*:
   - Once there are no more customers, and the shop has been closed for a while, the barbers clean up and go home.

7. *The Game Ends*:
   - The game waits until all barbers have gone home (all the little workers have stopped working).
   - Then it says, "Barbershop is closed, all barbers have gone home."

The code is like the rules of this barbershop game. It tells the computer how to play the game, step by step, so that the barbers and customers do everything right, and in the end, the shop closes nicely with no one left inside.
